# Rockbuster: SQL Analysis Project
This repo holds my SQL analysis project from the Rockbuster case. 
Rockbuster is a movie rental company trying to pivot into online streaming to compete with Netflix and Amazon. 
My job as a data analyst was to help the business team figure out how to make smart decisions based on the data they already had.

# What I worked on
I loaded Rockbuster’s data into PostgreSQL, cleaned it, and ran multiple SQL queries to answer key business questions. These included:
- Which movies made the most or least money?
- How long do people typically rent a movie?
- Which countries have the most customers?
- Where are the most valuable customers located?
- Do sales numbers vary by region?

# Tools used
- PostgreSQL (for querying and managing data)
- pgAdmin (for running SQL and checking results)
- Excel + Tableau (for final presentation and charts)

# What’s in this repo
- SQL queries answering the business questions above
- A cleaned-up version of the data analysis logic
- Comments in each script to explain what’s going on

# Final Output
I presented everything in a clean format using Excel and Tableau. The goal was to help the management board quickly understand the data and use it to guide their online strategy.
